# Vehicle Price Prediction
> Data science project using different Machine Learning algorithms.
> The full dataset can be found [_here_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZqmuDjNJjMj7hDivgsukOjrscry-KGpz/view).

> Moreover, there is a *light* demo [_here_](https://share.streamlit.io/dimitriosdelegkos/vehicle-streamlit/app.py).

## Overview
The **goal** of this project is to make a model which can predict the price of a vehicle, given a sequence of features.

The data includes various information for the vehicles, such as the model, manufacturer, condition, etc.

## Technologies Used
- `matplotlib` - version 3.5.1
- `numpy` - version 1.22.1
- `pandas` - version 1.4.0
- `scikit_learn` - version 1.0.2
- `seaborn` - version 0.11.2
- `xgboost` - version 1.5.2
